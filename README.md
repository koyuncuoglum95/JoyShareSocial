## JoyShare Social App

1.) Save the post to the database using Django's ORM, and redirect the user to the newly created post's page.

2.) Consider using Django's built-in authentication framework to restrict group creation to authenticated users only.

3.) Implement server-side validation to ensure that the user is not already a member of the group.

4.) Use Django's built-in views and models to create a form for creating a new post.
